<!--- climate change --->
<h2>Climate Change Series</h2>
<div class="well well-sm">
	Effects of large-scale teleconnections on biological processes. I have a couple of more interesting stories to tell in this series. However, I have been working on other projects recently. I wish I have some grad students, then I can "work" on this too. Well, until then, there won't be any updates.

<!--- seabird conservation --->
<h2>Seabird Conservation Series</h2>
<div class="well well-sm">
	Thoughts, research and behind scene stories. One last piece, and then I am done with this series. It is hard to secure research funding for the conservation of wildlife that do not have any immediate commercial value.

<!--- surveys --->
<h2>Automating Surveys Series</h2>
<div class="well well-sm">
	This series of articles is inspired by a research survey that I participate in. The objective here is to more or less establish, by way of writing and thinking about it, a standard and free way to conduct surveys for scientific research. People who need to conduct surveys should find my endevour useful.
