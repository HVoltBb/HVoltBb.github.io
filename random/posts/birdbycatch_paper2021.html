<h2>Seabird vulnerability in pelagic longline fisheries</h2>

<div class="well well-sm">
<p>Summary:</p> 
<p><span class="label label-success">Background</span> The incidental mortality of seabirds in fisheries remains a serious global concern. Obtaining unbiased and accurate estimates of bycatch rates is one of the priorities for seabird bycatch mitigation and demographics research. For measuring the capture risk of seabird interactions in fisheries, carcass retrieval rate from hauled gear is commonly used. </p>
<p><span class="label label-success">Problem statement</span> However, reliability can be limited by a lack of direct capture observations and the substantial pre-haul bycatch losses known to occur, meaning incidence of seabird bycatch is underestimated. </p>
<p><span class="label label-success">Contribution</span> To solve this problem, a new measure (i.e., bycatch vulnerability) that links an observed interaction directly to the underlying capture event is proposed to represent the capture risk of fishery interactions by seabirds. The new measure is not affected by subsequent bycatch loss. To illustrate how to estimate and analyse bycatch vulnerability, a case study based on a long-term dataset of seabird interactions and capture confirmation is provided. Bayesian modelling and hypothesis testing were conducted to identify important bycatch risk factors. Competition was found to play a central role in determining seabird bycatch vulnerability. More competitive environments were riskier for seabirds, and larger and thus more competitive species were more at risk than smaller sized and less competitive species. Species foraging behaviour also played a role. On the other hand, we did not find any evidence on the additional effect of physical oceanic condition and spatio-temporal factors. </p>
<p><span class="label label-success">Recommendations</span> Bycatch vulnerability is recommended as a replacement for the commonly used bycatch rate or carcass retrieval rate to measure the capture risk of an interaction. Combined with a normalized contact rate, bycatch vulnerability offers an unbiased estimate of seabird bycatch rate in pelagic longline fisheries.</p>
