<h1>How to add comments to your GitHub pages in 2020</h1>
<p>This post came out of the lack of easy to follow and updated information on how to add the ability to comment on a static site such as Github pages. There are multiple ways to do this. Some require you set up a remote server, which will cost you a little bit, and some are completely free to you, which means that the comments data and their maintanance are stored and managed by service providers. In this post, I am only listing some of the free methods that I have tried out on my <a href={{site.url}}>GitHub page</a>, and they are:</p>
<p>1, <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> comments,</p>
<p>2, <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> comments.</p>
<p>I have used disqus commenting for a while, and I am quite satisfied with it. Disqus offers everything you want plus anonymous commenting. The guest DO NOT have to register a disqus account to post a comment. This feature is not turned on by default, and you need to enable it through your ADMIN settings on disqus.com. It is a great feature, although the CAPTCHA validation can be REALLY annoying for a non-registered user. Once you are registerd with disqus, it is relatively painless to use their system. For the facebook comments system, you DO have to log into your facebook account, and there's no option to hide your identity. Both are easy to configure and use. OK, let's get started. Note that there are multiple ways to do this, and the following is only my way of doing it.</p>
<h2>1, Disqus</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Get a disqus account</h3>
<p>Go to <a href="https://disqus.com/">https://disqus.com/</a>, and get yourself a free account. Then, log in and click on the gear button <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> on the upper right, and click on <b>Add Disqus To Site</b>. Then go to the bottom of the page and click on <b>GET STARTED</b>. On the next page, click <b>I want to install Disqus on my site</b>. On the next page, enter the name of you website, which can be any valid URL string, and pick a category for your website. See the screenshot below for an example. </p>
