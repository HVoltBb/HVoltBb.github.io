<h2>What if I find a mistake in a published article?</h2>
</div>

<p>I would say it is pretty common to see mistakes/errors in published articles. I am not talking about typos or grammatical errors here but misinterpretation of results. Nowadays, since pretty much everything is done with a pre-packaged software, there is not much room for error in applying a statistical method either. Someone famous (Sorry about my poor memory) once said that regression is the most successful yet most abused statistical method so far. I couldn't agree more. You have to admit everybody can do some analysis, but not everyone can do it correctly.</p>

<p>The best way is to just ignore those articles. Actually, I got this idea from my PhD advisor. He once said that it is not worthwhile to write an article to correct them (poorly conducted studies) unless it is a Science or Nature article. I think it makes sense. Not citing a poorly conducted study is like helping slow down the spread of misinformation especially in a field like ecology, where cross-examination is close to impossible and retraction is rare.</p>

<p>There are two types of potential mistakes, "hard" mistakes and "soft" mistakes. These are the terms one of my high school teachers uses (sorry, I forgot your name too). He said that always try to find "hard" mistakes, serious mistakes that are crucial to the correctness of a statement, not "soft" mistakes, which may or may not be true but doesn't really matter with respect to the validity of a statement. Over the years in high school and afterwards, I have gotten into the habit of simply ignoring non-essential details, and concentrate just on the core idea. A side effect of being like this is that I am not a detail oriented person, which is a nice attribute to have in many situations.</p>

<p>So <b>what if I find a mistake in a published article?</b> My advice on this is to discuss it with your friends and colleagues to see what they think. It could be a false positive sometimes. Either way, try to use it as a learning opportunity and never cite that paper for the sake of attacking it if you are 99% sure it has been poorly conducted. If not, that paper will get a new citation, and people would think this paper is a good one. Let's just admit this: we almost always just read title and abstract but never the full text. People will not realise it is a downvote intead of a upvote most of the times, and may even spread the misinformation more.</p>

<p>Also, don't be so serious.</p>

<p class="some-padding">Anyway, this is just my opinion. I don't think there is a right or wrong answer here, just like almost everything else in real life. </p>
