			<td>Journal titles should appear in the abbreviated form. To achieve this, you need to import Journal title abbreviations seperately. The Zoological Records (ZR) file has the most consistent abbreviations of the terms needed, but occationally, it deviates from the abbreviations used by BCI. Especially, the abbreviation of the journal itself should be "Bird Conserv. Internatn." instead of "Bird Conserv. Int." as provided in the ZR file.</td>

<h2>How to use abbreviated journal names</h2>
<p>Follow the official instructions <a href="https://support.clarivate.com/Endnote/s/article/EndNote-Generate-full-or-abbreviated-journal-names">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Other things</h2>
<p>NONE of the Endnote output styles provided above are the official style files or exist in the <a href="https://endnote.com/downloads/styles/">Endnote output style database</a>. If you are using my style file, the reference list will be inserted at the end of each section in your word document. If you don't have any section breaks, that will be the end of document. I highly recommend you to insert a section break between your main text and tables section. This way, you don't need to copy and paste your reference list every time you update your references. If you notice any discrepancies between my Endnote output styles and the official style, comment below.</p>
