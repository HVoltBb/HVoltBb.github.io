			<td>Journal titles should appear in the abbreviated form. To achieve this, you need to import Journal title abbreviations seperately. The Zoological Records (ZR) file has the most consistent coverage of the terms needed, but occationally, it deviates from the abbreviations used by BCI. Especially, the abbreviation of the journal itself should be "Bird Conserv. Internatn." instead of "Bird Conserv. Int." as provided in the ZR file.</td>
