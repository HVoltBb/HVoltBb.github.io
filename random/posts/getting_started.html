	From a noob to a pro: Getting started on seabird bycatch modelling
</h2>
</div>
<p>
	For whatever your reason you have decided to study seabird bycatch quantitatively. This tutorial will get you started right away. I am not assuming any specific background knowledge about fishing or seaibrd biology. However, it is assumed that you have taken your undergraduate level biology and math courses. For the analytical skills, calculus is your best friend, but when it is not available, you can always use logic.
</p>
<p>
	I list the core literature below. They deserve to be read in full, not just the title and abstract. I have read them multiple times, and each time I get some fresh ideas on seabird research. Note that the order of the list is significant. It is recommended to start from the 1st item and go down the list one by one. Also the provided external link may break without notice. In that case, a simple google search can help you locate the article.

<p>Note that the modelling articles included above have all taken a Bayesian approach, which is not absolutely required. Bayesian computational methods are notoriously slow, but since the dataset for seabird bycatch is usually small, that slugginess doesn't hurt that much. In case you have a moderately large dataset, it is recommended to ditch the Bayesian way and the modelling stragegy should hold no matter which computational method you choose to take.</p>
<p>Also note that I have left out a vast body of literature on seabird bycatch that are purely observational. For example, the bycatch rate in region A is X bird/thousand hooks in year Y - Z. Such references are excellent for your introductory section or provide raw data for your meta-analysis. But for a modeller, you need to think much deeper than that.</p>
