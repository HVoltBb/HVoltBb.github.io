<h2>Get to know your FLIR IR camera like never before!</h2>
<p>First, why I feel the urge to write this post? Lately, I have been analyzing IR images taken by someone who doesn't know much about the tool their using. I don't even need to say here that much of the effort spent to take those images were in vain partly because of their lack of knowledge of how IR imaging works and partly because of the design of the camera. An IR camera is NOT a smart device, which means that you need to be smart this time, otherwise your images will make you look stupid!</p>
<p>It is a FLIR E6 IR camera for building analysis. Here is the website of this product (https://www.flir.com/products/e6/). I'll go over the specs sheet in this post, and maybe talk more about how to take your images properly in another post, because it will be a much longer topic and requires basic knowledge of optics and IR, which I will cover here.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>1. Accuracy: +/- 2C or 2% (which ever is larger) for ambient T 10C to 35C and object T above 0C.</span> The accuracy of this camera is quite low. For example, when the real object T is 20C, readings from anywhere between 18C to 22C is acceptible according to FLIR. Your skin probably can do better than that! The range of ambient T is the range of T that the sensor has been calibrated to work properly with the indicated accuracy. That's why there is even a range on the T ambient here. On the other hand, object T can be anywhere above 0C. This lower bound should be related to possible icy conditions (more reflective) under 0C, but I am not sure 100%.</p>
<p><span>2. Detector type: uncooled microbolometer.</span> Here, uncooled means that the IR sensor is not enclosed in a T controled enclosure, and this is also why there is a working T range for the T ambiant for this camera. This is a handheld device with an unremovable handle attached. It is unlikely someone would put it inside a hot oven to take some pics. So, I am cool with it being uncooled. For the micro..., Wikipedia has done a good job explaining it, and I am not repeating them here.</p>
<p><span>3. Field of view (FOV): 45 degree x 34 degree.</span> Field of view is a distance independent measure of the observable area through an opticle device, having a unit of angle. For a round lens, its FOV would normally be a portion of a sphere. But since our sensor is a rectangular array, the FOV is horizontal viewing angle (degrees) times vertical viewing angle (degrees), like a landscape photo. The viewing angle of this camera is relatively large for an IR camera. It is fitting because this device is designed for building inspectors to examine large structures from far away. For a different use case, we will see telescopic lenses instead. FOV is closely related to the instantaneous FOV or IFOV, which will be explained later. </p>
<p><span>4. IR resolution: 160x120 pixels.</span> The sensor is made of an array of 160x120 (19,200) tiny little IR detectors. We will calcualate the dimension of the IR sensor later when we have enough info.</p>
<p>Bla bla bla (easy stuff)</p>
<p><span>5. Thermal sensitivity/NETD: <0.06C.</span> NETD stand for noice equivalent differential temperature, which is a mouthful. Basically, your IR sensor, that microbolometer, if you still remember that word, is a analog device, capable of outputing continuous changes in resistance to a digitizer, which is acting like a binning device. When the change (+/-) in T is larger or equal to 0.06C, the value got bumped up or down to a different value; otherwise, it stay put and that T difference is treated as background noise. So each bin is 0.12C. For this camera, each detector outputs a 16bit value, covering 256 different Ts for a specific range. When the T span is small or equal to 256x0.12 (30.72C), the optimal sensivity is maintained; when the T span is larger than 30.72C, the sensivity between some T readings will exceend its design thermal sensitivity because of digitizing. So, keep the T range below 30C, as a rule of thumb for this camera.</p>
<p>Be careful about sensitivity here. Normally, it means that the sensor can detect the presence of the T difference; however, the output may change in either direction with any magnitude within its design accuracy (2C), which is quite large. So a 0.06C increase in T may register a 1C decrease reading, and the device can be working just as it was designed to do! Just be careful here. Don't be too confident about the data you have and interpreting the noise. </p>
<p>Bla bla bla</p>
<p><span>Operating Temperature Range: -15C to 50C.</span> This is the T range where you camera will turn on and display something, anything. Working outside the range specified in the Accuracy line will potentially produce junk. There will be no guarrentee of any accuracy there.</p>
<p><span>Emissivity table: 0.1 to 1.0.</span> This is the emissivity for the whole picture. It is basically useless when you want to read T from two or more surfaces from a single pic. Keep it as is. Use software to do the calc later. </p>
<p><span>f-number: 1.5.</span> Read the wikipedia page for this one (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number).</p>
<p><span>Focus: focus free.</span> Again wikipedia here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-focus_lens). Basically, the lens can focus on objects (depth of field) from a fixed distance all the way to infinity (for the lens at least). For the IR sensor, the depth of field is limited by the spatial resolution. </p>
<p><span>Image Frequency: 9 Hz.</span> This is the shutter speed, 1/9 of a second of exposure time. Your everyday camera typically have a shutter speed of 1/60, or 60 Hz FLIR speak. 9 Hz is very slow. Try 1/9 sec exposure on your phone and take a pic. It will blur like hell, which probably explains partly why your IR image blur like hell. Practice your steady hands with you phone cam and then try your FLIR E6. Now, I suspect E means economical here. So far, every spec looks economical.</p>
<p><span>Minimum Focus Distance: 0.5m. </span>Rememer, your lens can't focus on objects nearer than its hyperfocal distance, which should be smaller than 0.5m. Read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-focus_lens">wiki page</>, if you want to learn more. </p>
<p><span>Spatial resolution (IFOV): 5.2 mrad.</span> Instantaneous field of view (IFOV) for the sensor is 5.2 mili-radian horizontally and vertically. In many places, IFOV is calculated as FOV/(# of detectors in a direction). But it is not a definition; it is a fast way to calculate IFOV to reasonabley high accuracy. The standard definition of IFOV is the range of incident angles seen by a single detecting element in the focal plane. IFOV is calculated as</p>
<p>IFOV = 2 arctan(d/(2f)),</p>
<p>where d is the length or width of a single detector (for obvious reasons, the detector should be a square), and f is the focal length. In addition, FOV is calculated as</p>
<p>FOV = 2 arctan(D/(2f)),</p>
<p>where D is the diameter of the field stop (aperture length), which is length of the array of detectors in a direction. For E6, D= 160xd in the horizontal direction.</p>
<p>When you do the calculation here, you will find out that the 5.2 mrad doesn't make sense here, it is too large. You will get 4.9 mrad if you follow any of the formulae here.  </p>
