<h2>A better uncertainty estimate of total seabird bycatch</h2>

<p>Assessing the uncertainty of total seabird bycatch synthesized from multiple sources by Zhou and Liao</p>

<div class="well well-sm">
<p><span class="label label-primary">Background</span> The highly migratory behavior of seabirds has implications for the uncertainty calculations of the total seabird bycatch estimate at a regional/global scale synthesized from individual assessments conducted at a local scale.</p>
<p><span class="label label-primary">Problem statement</span> To efficiently characterize the accuracy and reliability of fisheries direct impact on seabird populations.</p>
<p><span class="label label-primary">Contribution</span> In addition to a theoretical exploration, we provide a hypothetical scenario analysis based on data from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission convention area. The results show that the assumptions on the correlation between different areas has a big impact on the uncertainty estimates, especially when the number of areas to synthesize is large, and simplifying assumptions failed to capture the complex dynamics of seabird bycatch rates among different areas.</p>
<p><span class="label label-primary">Recommendations</span> Empirically estimate the correlation of bycatch rates between each pair of sources when time series of bycatch rates are available.

    The central idea of this study can be summarized in one sentence - the traditional approach of tallying total seabird bycatch from individual assessment reports over-estimate the uncertainty bounds by A LOT! It turns out that we can do much better using the strategy detailed in this paper. The meat of this study is in fact the supplement hiding at the tail section of this article. One of the reviewers feared that those equations would turn away many potential readers who actually may benefit from reading it (my own interpretation). The editor suggested and we all agreed that hiding those equations in a supplement would be a better approach. Those who need those formulae can still find them, and those who don't want to see them won't. The rest of the article provides nessesary biological context/background, and a solved hypothetical problem from the Western and North Pacific. The strategy detailed here works not only for seabirds, but also for other highly migratory species, like marine mammals, ü¶à ü§∑ and turtles.

    <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/birds">Birds</a> is a relatively new fully open access ornithology journal with a very broad scope. Their editorial team has been super helpful in assisting us with the revisions, and their peer-review process is as rigorous as any other traditional journals we have had experience with, which can be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you are looking for ‚ò†Ô∏è If you have a new idea or a new finding, do consider <i>Birds</i>. Their turnaround cycle is very fast, although not as fast as they advertised in our case. I am pretty sure this journal will thrive. May need a little bit of time to get there. I am not affiliated in any way with the journal or received any compensation from the journal for this opinion.
