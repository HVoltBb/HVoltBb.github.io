    The central idea of this study can be summarized in one sentence - the traditional approach of tallying total seabird bycatch from individual assessment reports over-estimate the uncertainty bounds by A LOT! It turns out that we can do much better using the strategy detailed in this paper. The meat of this study is in fact the supplement hiding at the tail section of this article. One of the reviewers feared that those equations would turn away many potential readers who actually may benefit from reading it (my own interpretation). The editor suggested and we all agreed that hiding those equations in a supplement would be a better approach. Those who need those formulae can still find them, and those who don't want to see them won't. The rest of the article provides nessesary biological context/background, and a solved hypothetical problem from the Western and North Pacific. The strategy detailed here works not only for seabirds, but also for other highly migratory species, like marine mammals, sharks and turtles.

    <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/birds">Birds</a> is a relatively new fully open access ornithology journal with a broad scope. Their editorial team has been super helpful in assisting us with the revisions, and their peer-review process is as rigorous as any other traditional journals we have experience with. If you have a new idea or a new finding, do consider <i>Birds</i>. Their turnaround cycle is very fast, although not as fast as they advertised. I am not affiliated in any way with the journal or received any compensation from the journal for this opinion.
