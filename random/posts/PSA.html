    Some casual discussions on the Productivity and Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) model
</h1>

<p>
    The PSA model is capable to rank populations in terms of its conservation urgency and label it as under either high, medium or low risk by combining both qualitative and quantitative information into two opposing aspects, the productivity of the biological population vs its susceptibility to perturbations. A pretty good idea, uh?
</p>

<p>
    Not at all. I am afraid the PSA won't be able to deliver any of the promises mentioned above. As it stands right now, it is just a fixed procedure. You assign numbers 1-3 to some items and get a risk score back, which can be used to rank different populations. It is not generalizable. Say you want to used 4 categories, or use a different set of numbers. I am afraid the new system won't be compatible with the old one. This is one of the reason why you don't see much research activity in this direction. I'll give one example below to show why this PSA idea is just a dead-end idea.
</p>

<p>
    However, last year, 2021, I did see a paper trying to add some probabiblistic flavor to this PSA thing. Again, nice idea. But I don't think there is much utility in their method. The flaky PSA idea aside, I think defining, or "redefining" as they put it in the title, risk level for the population you have no information on is plain meaningless. On the other hand, I would design a "unconcious ecologist" test based on their procedure, but then which ecologist in their right mind would use it? The completely unconcious ones, maybe.
</p>

<p>
    OK. Back to the PSA thing. Here is the example. There are two populations A and B and 10 items to be evaluated for each population. In procedure 1, we assign numbers 1, 2, and 3 in ascending risk level; and in procedure 2, we assign numbers 1, 3, and 5 instead. This seems harmless, but you will see later that this simple change switched the ranking of risk of these populations. We will see later why we might want to use 1, 3 and 5 instead.

    Say the evaluation for A is $[]$
