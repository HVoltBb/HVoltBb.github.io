    <h2>Little Things your instructor never bothered to tell you about</h2>
</div>
<p>This is a list of minor things across many subject areas that have bothered me for some time. I hope my instructors had explained these things to me when they introduced those ideas but good things only rarely happens. Anyway, this is going to be a never ending list.</p>
<h3>Why the f**k is the pdf of random variable X written as \(f_X(X=x)\)?</h3>
<p>
There are simply way too many Xs there, don't you agree? I never quite understood why you need so many both upper- and lower-case Xs in that function name until recently. Let's write that pdf in an equivalent form. It is perfectly fine to write it as \(g(X=y)\), where \(g\) is the pdf of some random variable, and \(y\) is the function argument. Now, we can parse \(f_X(X=x)\), where \(f_X\equiv g\), and \(x\equiv y\). Does \(f_X(X=x)\) still look cryptic to you?
</p>
<h3>\(E(X|Y)\) is a random variable and \(E(X|Y=y)\) is a function, what?!</h3>
<p>
Statistics text is usually quite succinct on words, not being wrong but not quite clear either. \(E(X|Y)\) is the expectation of random variable X given random variable Y, and the expectation is taken with respect to X. So at the end it is just a function of Y, in other words, just another random variable. The expectation is taken with respect to X because Y is given, in other words, Y, whatever it is, is considered constant in the expectation. For the other expression, we fix the value of Y to y, so it is not random anymore, and therefore, it becomes a function in y. A mouthful, isn't it. At the start, you want someone to give you the more verbose version and after awhile, you may prefer the shorter version since no information is lost in the shorter version and you save a few keystrokes. BTW, \(E(X)\) is still a constant.
