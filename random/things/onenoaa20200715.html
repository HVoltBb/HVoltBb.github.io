	<p>I am sorry that the whole website is currently greyed out (7/13 2020), and the links are so hard to see. You may leave any questions or comments below, and I'll answer them as soon as I see them.</p>
	<p>At the end of the webinar, we conducted a quick poll among webinar attendees. The poll below is the same one sent out during the webinar, and the poll result from the webinar attendees is [1, 0, 14, 0, 10], which is used as the base result here. If you have already submitted your answer at the webinar, do not participate again. To view the real-time result without voting, click <<a href="https://linkto.run/r/BTGX1A9A" target="_blank">here</a>> or click on <b>Vote</b> below without making any choices. When you click through this poll, you may also find a page to leave comments. At the very end, there will be a link for you to share this poll with others and another link to view the live results. The poll is inactivated on July 15, 2020, and it will be re-activated on Sep 2, 2020 before the webinar begins.</p>
