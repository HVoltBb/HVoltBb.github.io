	<p>At the end of the webinar, we conducted a quick poll among the webinar attendees. The poll question below is the same one sent out during the webinar, and the poll result from the webinar attendees are [1, 0, 14, 0, 10], which is used as the base result here. If you have already selected your choice at the webinar, do not participate again. To view the real-time result without voting, click [<a href="https://linkto.run/r/BTGX1A9A">here</a>] or click on <b Vote></b> below without selecting any choices. When you click through this poll, you may also find a page to place your comments and there is also a link for you to share this poll to others and another link to view the live results. </p>

	<p>I am sorry that the whole website is currently greyed out (7/13 2020), and the links are so hard to see. You may leave any questions or comments below, and I'll answer them as soon as I see them.</p>
