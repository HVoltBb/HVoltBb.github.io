<h2>Data</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p class='n'>Through my years as a data analyst, I mainly use data collected and collated by others. Only rarely do I generate new data myself; when I do, they are <em>secondary</em> data based on primary sources like literature and field experts. This short article on sharing your research data and <a class="btn btn-xs btn-info" href="/data/public_data.html" role="button">public data</a> summarizes my current view on this issue. I hope that people can find value in those scientific surveys, and generate a healthy demand on the data that are generated. This demand could provide some incentive for the public agency to improve the quality of the data and even better the sampling protocol; otherwise, it is just a waste of public resources to do those expensive surveys in the first place. In a sense, we, the data analysts, justify their public spending for them <em>for free</em>, and they should make the data sharing process as pain free as possible. OK, enough ranting.</p>

<p class='n'>Do take a look at my meager amount of data, and if you find an error, please let me know.</p>
