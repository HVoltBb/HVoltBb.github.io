<h2>Data</h2>

<p class='n'>Through my years as a data analyst, I mainly use data collected and collated by others. Only rarely do I generate new data myself; when I do, they are <em>secondary</em> data based on primary sources like literature and field experts. This short article on sharing your research data, and <a class="btn btn-sm btn-info" href="/data/public_data.html" role="button">Public data</a></p> summarizes my current view on this issue. I hope that people can find value in those scientific surveys, and generate a healthy demand on the data that is generated. This demand could push the public agency to improve the quality of the data; otherwise, it is a waste of public resources to do those surveys in the first place. In some sense, we, the data analysts, justify their public spending for them <em>for free</em>, and they should make this process as pain free as possible.

<p class='n'>Do take a look at my meager amount of data, and if you find an error, please let me know.</p>
