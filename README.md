I created this website to organize my software packages and data sets that I have created over the years. Feel free to explore things that I posted here. In addition, I have placed randoms posts here and there on this website. Those posts themselves are about random things, not necessarily about scientific computing or programing, they are the things that would normally appear in a blog.
