<h2>About me</h2>
</div>
<div>
	<p>This website hosts some of my packages and code samples for data analysis.</p>
	<p>To learn more about my education and past experiences, check <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/can-zhou-65970838">my LinkedIn</a> profile. Here is a copy of my <a href="https://hvoltbb.github.io/about/cv.html">CV</a>. Sorry, no easy downloads are provided in order to protect my privacy. In the past, my online accounts have been attacked unsuccessfully multiple times by unknown people. I am just making their life a bit more difficult. Or should I say several bits? &#x1F606;</p>
	<p>BTW, I am not a fan of spell checkers. If there are words spelled wrong here and there, that's because I write this website on a text editor which doesn't have a spell checker. But I will correct them when I see them.</p>
