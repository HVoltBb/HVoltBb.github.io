<h2>About me</h2>

<div>
	<p>This website hosts some of my packages and code samples for data analysis.</p>
	<p>To learn more about my education and past experiences, check <a href="#">my LinkedIn</a> profile. To avoid any political retribution, links that can be used to physically identify me has been removed. You can still post comments however. Considering that in this day and age, it is not possible to stay anonymous, I am just making finding me a bit difficult.</p>
