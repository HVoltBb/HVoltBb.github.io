				<p>I analyze the hidden structure of natural systems based on observed data. Most of the time, I am using <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>, and it is reflected in the high percentage of R related projects (100% as of 5/21/2019). I am exploring other tools, such as python and C for other projects, and I am expecting that percentage to go down over time. You can <a href="/about">read more about me</a>, and <a href="/projects">my projects</a>.</p>
