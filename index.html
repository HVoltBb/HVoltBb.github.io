        		<h2>Hello from Dr Can Z!</h2>
				<p>I analyze the hidden structure of natural systems based from observed data. I have used <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>, C, Java and Python for scientific computation before. The specific tool I choose for project largely depends on the existing code base, because I am not a fan of repetation.</p>
				<p>You can find my softwares listed under projects. All the them are open source and hosted on GitHub. I also have generated some datasets in research. Some of them maybe useful to you, and they are listed under the data folder.</p>
				<p>You can read <a href="/about">more about me</a>, and <a href="/projects">my projects</a>.</p>
