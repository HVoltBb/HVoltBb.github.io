        		<h2>Hello from Can Z!</h2>
				<p>I analyze the hidden structure of natural systems based from observed data. Most of the time, I am using <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>, and it is reflected in the high percentage of R related projects (100% as of 5/21/2019). I am also exploring other tools, such as python and C for other projects, for functionality and better performance, and I am expecting that percentage to go down over time.</p>
