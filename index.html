<p>Based on observed data. I use scientific programming tools <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>, and also generic ones, such as C, Java and Python, to perform data analysis. The specific tool I choose for a project largely depends on the existing code base, since I am lazy and not a fan of repetation.</p>
<p>You can find my softwares listed under projects. All the them are open source and hosted on GitHub. I also have generated some datasets in research. Some of them maybe useful to you, and they are listed under the data folder.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="/about">more about me</a>, and <a href="/projects">my projects</a>.</p>
