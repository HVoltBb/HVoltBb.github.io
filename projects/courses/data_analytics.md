This course is an introduction to statistical learning using R. In this course, students are exposed to a collection of relatively simple statistical models with varying degrees of complexity. The emphasis is on the hands-on application of machine learning methods on various datasets rather than a theoretical treatment. This is a standard 1 semester course with a lab component. Previous experience with a statistical programming language is recommended but not required. Likewise, previous knowledge in college-level calculus, linear algegra, and statistics is recommended but not required. The core structure of the course is as follows:

1. An Introduction to R
   + Data Types
   + Data Structures
   + Functions, Packages
   + Control Structures, Debugging
   + Plotting
2. Regression
   + k Nearest Neighours Regression
   + Regression Trees
   + Gradient Descent
   + Linear Regression
3. Classification
   + k Nearest Neighours Classification
   + Classification Trees
