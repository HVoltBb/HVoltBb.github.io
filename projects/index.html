<h2>Free advanced online courses</h2>

<ul class="stuff">
	<li><a href="./courses/numerical_la.html" target="_blank">Numerical Linear Algebra</a> [in progress] <a href="https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen 3.4.0</a> will be used for the computation.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="stuff">
	<li><a href="./courses/algebra.html" target="_blank">Abstract Algebra</a> [in progress] based on Fall 2003 Math 122 (E-222) by Benedict Gross at Harvard. The orinigial course webpage at Harvard was retired after 2015. I have put together the original course resources from the internet, including full recorded video lecture series, lecture notes, syllabus, and homework sets. Note: none of the resourse items is hosted by me, and you will be taken to respective repositories to view those course items.</li>

<ul class='stuff'>
	<li><a href="/2019nCov/" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>, evaluating new evidence in the early dynamics of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with real time domestic traffic and potential asymptomatic transmissions (<a href="/data/index.html#COVD-19">data</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HVoltBb/2019nCov/blob/master/src/">code</a>).</li>
	<li>
		<a href="/random/things/onenoaa20200715.html">Webinar resources</a> for "Out of sight, out of notebook: Seabird bycatch loss in pelagic longline fisheries" kindly hosted by Tracy Gill as one of <a href="https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/seminars/" target="_blank">OneNOAA Science Seminars</a> on July 15th, 2020, and "Estimating seabird bycatch loss in pelagic longline fisheries" kindly hosted by Dr. Mridula Srinivasan from the Protected Resources and Biodiversity Division of NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center on Sep 2nd, 2020.

<div class="well">
	<p>I am always currious about how people name their projects. Curiously, the names of my R packages (konez and kodonz) all start with a 'k' and end with a 'z'. Maybe it is related to how my name is pronounced, maybe not. </p>
